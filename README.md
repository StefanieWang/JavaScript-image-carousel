# Project: Creating an Image Carousel/Slider in Javascript

A simple image carousel / slider which cycles through some preloaded images from The Odin Project's [Project: Creating an Image Carousel/Slider in Javascript.](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/creating-an-image-carousel-slider)
1. It contains arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backwards. 
2. It automatically moves forward every 3 seconds. 
3. It contains the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on 
   (and they are click-able to advance to that particular slide).
